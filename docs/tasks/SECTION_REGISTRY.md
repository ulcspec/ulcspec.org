# Section Registry

This file is the authoritative list of implementation sections for this
project. It is kept separate from PRD.md to prevent hybrid pointer+registry
files whose shape is internally contradictory.

## Registry

_Sections appear here as they're shaped. Add new entries by running
`/lp-shape-section <name>` — don't hand-edit unless you know what you're
doing._

<!-- BEGIN REGISTRY -->
<!-- Entries are appended below by /lp-shape-section. Example shape:

### <section-name>
- **Status:** shaped | designed | planned | built
- **Spec:** [docs/tasks/sections/<section-name>.md](sections/<section-name>.md)
- **Added:** YYYY-MM-DD
-->
<!-- END REGISTRY -->

---

## How the registry is used

- `/lp-shape-section` writes spec files to `docs/tasks/sections/` and appends
  an entry to the registry above.
- `/lp-plan <section>` reads the registry to find the spec file.
- `/lp-build` validates the plan was generated from a registry-known section
  before autonomous execution.
- Consumers that predate this split still read PRD.md as a fallback
  (deprecation warning to stderr); the shim is removed in v1.1.
