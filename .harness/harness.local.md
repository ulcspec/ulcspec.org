# ulcspec.org harness context

> Project-specific review context surfaced to /lp-review and /lp-harden-plan.
> Edit this file to record local conventions, known sharp edges, and
> reviewer guidance that is too situational for `docs/architecture/`.

## Local conventions

  * (add project-specific rules here, e.g., "all DB writes go through
    packages/db/, never raw queries")

## Known sharp edges

  * (failure modes reviewers should look out for, e.g., "X breaks if Y
    is null because of legacy column nullability")

## Review priorities

  * (where to focus extra attention, e.g., "auth boundaries", "billing
    state transitions")

## Out of scope for review

  * (drift the team has accepted, e.g., "CSS hex colors instead of
    tokens are tech-debt, not blockers")
